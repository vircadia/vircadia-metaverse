import { Request } from "express";

// Criteria filters are used to filter collections of entities.
// They work by taking an enumeration stream and returning a stream
//    with only entities  that fit the criteria.
// They work with the MongoDB database and create query filters
//    so the queries return only the selected entities.
// After construction, the filter is gets parameters from the request
//    URL. A call to 'parametersFromRequest' with a request query like
//    '?pagenum=5' would be selecting only page 5 entries.
// The criteria filter is called before making the MongoDB query and
//    can return MongoDB query pieces if it can be done. The filter
//    doesn't have to do DB query filtering as it is called for each
//    found entity so it can test them. So, filters usually either
//    return a DB query filter when called by 'criteriaParameters' or
//    does the test with 'criteriaTest'.
// The call 'addResponseFields' is called after the request is completed
//    and is used mostly by Pagination to add page info to the query
//    response.

    //    is implemented.
